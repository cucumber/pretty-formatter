Feature: Usage of a `Rule`

  Rule: A sale cannot happen if the customer does not have enough money

    Example: Not enough money                                 # samples/rules/rules.feature:9
      Given the customer has 100 cents                        # samples/rules/rules.ts:4
      And there are chocolate bars in stock                   # samples/rules/rules.ts:8
      When the customer tries to buy a 125 cent chocolate bar # samples/rules/rules.ts:16
      Then the sale should not happen                         # samples/rules/rules.ts:22

    Example: Enough money                                    # samples/rules/rules.feature:16
      Given the customer has 100 cents                       # samples/rules/rules.ts:4
      And there are chocolate bars in stock                  # samples/rules/rules.ts:8
      When the customer tries to buy a 75 cent chocolate bar # samples/rules/rules.ts:16
      Then the sale should happen                            # samples/rules/rules.ts:26
