Undefined scenarios:
  1) An undefined step causes a failure # samples/undefined/undefined.feature:8
       Given a step that is yet to be defined
  2) Steps before undefined steps are executed # samples/undefined/undefined.feature:11
       And a step that is yet to be defined
  3) Steps after undefined steps are skipped # samples/undefined/undefined.feature:15
       Given a step that is yet to be defined
  4) Snippets reflect parameter types # samples/undefined/undefined.feature:19
       Given a list of 8 things

4 scenarios (4 undefined)
6 steps (1 passed, 1 skipped, 4 undefined)
0m 0.21s (0m 0.1s executing your code)

You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:

Given("a step that is yet to be defined", () => {
  return "pending"
})

Given("a list of {int} things", (int: number) => {
  return "pending"
})

Given("a list of {float} things", (float: number) => {
  return "pending"
})
