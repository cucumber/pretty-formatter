Scenario: Skipping from a step doesn't affect the previous steps # samples/skipped/skipped.feature:9
  Given a step that does not skip                                # samples/skipped/skipped.ts:3
  And I skip a step                                              # samples/skipped/skipped.ts:11

Scenario: Skipping from a step causes the rest of the scenario to be skipped # samples/skipped/skipped.feature:13
  Given I skip a step                                                        # samples/skipped/skipped.ts:11
  And a step that is skipped                                                 # samples/skipped/skipped.ts:7
